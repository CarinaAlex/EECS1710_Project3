# Dotted Squirrel

**Summary**

When you run this code you you will see 25,000 dots of varying colours dancing around to eventually form the shape of a squirrel. 

The image can be replaced so that the dots will take on a different shape, consistent with the image fed in the set up on line 20.

**How to deal with restrictions imposed by RAM and CPU**

If the code is running too slowly, the number of dots can be reduced in the first tab under line 1. Change this value from 25,000 to something smaller and the code should run faster. However, please note the higher the number of dots the more detailed the end image will be once those dots have stopped moving.

To compensate for reduced number of dots, you can change the diameter of each indivudal dot under the "Ball" tab on line 10. If you increase this value you will get a better image. This is only effective and necessary if the number of balls was reduced significantly in line 1 of the main tab.
